# Syntax Rules

Syntax Rules are a collection of Scheme macros I find useful. All of them are based on `syntax-rules` form and are meant for R7RS-compilant Schemes.

## Running

For development I use [Chibi Scheme](//code.google.com/p/chibi-scheme) (the latest build from Mercurial trunk).

Tests for Syntax Rules are written with [Testing Essentials](//github.com/ilammy/te) (which are written with Syntax Rules in turn).

## Licensing

Syntax Rules are distributed under **[3-clause BSD license](LICENSE)**.
